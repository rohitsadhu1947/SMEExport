Detailed Solution Description - IMPLEMENTATION STATUS
=====================================================

STATUS: ✅ COMPLETE - All Phases Successfully Implemented

Project Overview
----------------
The solution is a product- and industry-agnostic platform designed to connect artisans, manufacturers, and small-scale producers with global export-import markets. The platform provides a seamless end-to-end journey for a user (artisan, small business, or manufacturer) — from onboarding and compliance to product definition, market intelligence, and transaction execution.

The system intelligently adapts to the selected industry (Leather and Carpets) and dynamically configures itself for industry-specific products, workflows, and market requirements. It is designed to support both the supply side (artisans) and the demand side (marketplace or buyers) in a scalable and highly modular way.

The solution consists of three key phases, all successfully implemented:

================================================================================
