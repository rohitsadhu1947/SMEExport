Detailed Solution Description
Project Overview
The solution is a product- and industry-agnostic platform designed to connect artisans, manufacturers, and small-scale producers with global export-import markets. The platform provides a seamless end-to-end journey for a user (artisan, small business, or manufacturer) — from onboarding and compliance to product definition, market intelligence, and transaction execution.
The system intelligently adapts to the selected industry (e.g., carpets, leather goods, handicrafts) and dynamically configures itself for industry-specific products, workflows, and market requirements. It is designed to support both the supply side (artisans) and the demand side (marketplace or buyers) in a scalable and highly modular way.
The solution consists of three key phases, along with overarching governance, analytics, and intelligence layers:

Phase 1: Artisan Onboarding & Profile Creation
Objective:  To enable the user to register, validate compliance, and build a digital profile that is both functional and actionable for marketplace intelligence.
Core Features:
	•	Company & Tax Registration: 
	•	Detect if the artisan’s company is registered, or if the user has valid tax/GST/other licenses. 
	•	Provide guided workflows to assist registration if needed. 
	•	Banking Information Integration: 
	•	Detect if bank accounts are linked; if not, help the user link bank accounts via previously integrated banking APIs. 
	•	Store verified account information securely for transactions. 
	•	Customer Profile Creation: 
	•	Capture essential company and individual details (owner info, business type, location, products, production capacity). 
	•	Enable dynamic forms for user input, including optional PII fields. 
	•	Government Scheme Detection (Phase 1 Applicable): 
	•	Pull data from relevant government databases to detect scheme eligibility, grants, or subsidies applicable at the onboarding stage. 
	•	Store eligibility metadata for downstream product creation and marketplace intelligence. 
	•	Intelligence Layer Initialization: 
	•	Based on artisan profile, suggest reachable and out-of-reach markets using historical trade data, product demand analysis, and compliance restrictions. 
	•	Establish baseline metrics for production capacity, product readiness, and financial eligibility. 
Outcome:  A fully validated artisan profile, bank-linked, tax-compliant, and ready to define products in Phase 2.

Phase 2: Product & Market Layer
Objective:  Enable the artisan to define products for the marketplace and discover market insights (demand, trends, price points).
Core Features:
	•	Product Catalog Integration: 
	•	Each artisan can define products and sub-products dynamically. 
	•	Support industry-specific fields, e.g., carpets: size, material, design complexity, price tier. 
	•	Configurator ensures conditional field logic, enabling flexible, non-linear input structures. 
	•	Market Intelligence: 
	•	Integrate market demand data, trend analytics, price benchmarking, and news feeds. 
	•	Recommend target markets (countries or regions) based on artisan profile, product specifications, and production capacity. 
	•	Calculate premium vs. standard pricing tiers using profile inputs and market intelligence. 
	•	Government Scheme Detection (Phase 2 Applicable): 
	•	Fetch and apply government schemes related to production, export promotion, or product-specific subsidies. 
	•	Dynamically calculate impact on pricing or product eligibility. 
	•	Configurator Integration: 
	•	Leverage the existing product configurator to define products, sub-products, addons, and optional features. 
	•	Conditional logic allows capturing phase-dependent pricing or quality variables. 
Outcome:  Products are fully defined, priced, and market-ready with associated intelligence, including applicable schemes and insights.

Phase 3: Artisan Input & Transaction Readiness
Objective:  Capture the production-ready input requirements for the artisan and ensure marketplace compatibility.
Core Features:
	•	Detailed Production Input Capture: 
	•	Material selection, craftsmanship specifications, quantity, and custom design options. 
	•	Conditional fields based on product type, premium/standard pricing tier, and government scheme eligibility. 
	•	Dynamic Compliance Checks: 
	•	Validate artisan input against marketplace requirements (e.g., labeling, quality standards, packaging). 
	•	Ensure any applicable scheme requirements are met before product goes live. 
	•	Transaction Preparation: 
	•	Prepare finalized product metadata, pricing, and compliance info for listing or export transaction. 
	•	Ensure bank account linkage and payment readiness. 
Outcome:  Artisan is fully ready to supply products to the marketplace, export-import system, or other buyers with validated inputs, pricing, and compliance metadata.

Intelligence & Governance Layer
	•	Market Intelligence Engine: 
	•	Continuously collects trade, pricing, and demand data. 
	•	Offers actionable recommendations to artisans on: 
	•	Target markets 
	•	Pricing adjustments 
	•	Product improvement suggestions 
	•	Government Scheme Integration: 
	•	Fetch and apply scheme information across phases (Phase 1: company schemes, Phase 2: product schemes). 
	•	Provide admin-controlled overlays for complex eligibility rules. 
	•	User Experience & Dynamic Configuration: 
	•	Highly modular UI allows admins to update fields, validation rules, or schemes without redeployment. 
	•	Enables dynamic product definitions across multiple industries. 

System Highlights
	•	Industry Agnostic: Can adapt to any sector (carpets, leather, electronics, clothing). 
	•	Dynamic Product Modeling: Configurator enables full product definition including conditional fields, addons, and pricing tiers. 
	•	Government Scheme Awareness: Real-time fetching and application of government schemes affecting pricing and eligibility. 
	•	Intelligence-Driven: Market intelligence guides product targeting, price setting, and potential expansion opportunities. 
	•	Phased Onboarding: Ensures artisan is validated, bank-linked, compliant, and ready before market exposure. 
	•	No Redeployments Needed: Admins can update rules, fields, and schemes dynamically via UI.

1. Overview
Purpose: A platform designed to onboard artisans and small-scale producers, assist them in compliance and banking, provide market intelligence, and facilitate product listing across industry-specific markets (textiles, leather, handicrafts, electronics, etc.) for export and domestic opportunities.
Goals: - Minimize onboarding friction through phased workflow. - Maintain industry-agnostic capabilities. - Dynamically overlay government schemes, pricing, and product inputs. - Provide data-driven market and product recommendations.
Phases: 1. Artisan Onboarding & Profile Creation 2. Market & Product Intelligence Layer 3. Product/Sub-product Input & Market Preparation
