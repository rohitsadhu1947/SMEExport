Artisan Market Exposure Platform – SRS & Architecture Document

1. Overview
Purpose: A platform designed to onboard artisans and small-scale producers, assist them in compliance and banking, provide market intelligence, and facilitate product listing across industry-specific markets (textiles, leather, handicrafts, electronics, etc.) for export and domestic opportunities.
Goals: - Minimize onboarding friction through phased workflow. - Maintain industry-agnostic capabilities. - Dynamically overlay government schemes, pricing, and product inputs. - Provide data-driven market and product recommendations.
Phases: 1. Artisan Onboarding & Profile Creation 2. Market & Product Intelligence Layer 3. Product/Sub-product Input & Market Preparation
Technology Stack: - Backend: Node.js / Java Spring Boot - Frontend: React / Flutter (Web & Mobile) - Database: PostgreSQL / MongoDB - Cloud Storage: AWS S3 / Azure Blob Storage - Authentication: OAuth2 / JWT - Messaging: Kafka / RabbitMQ for asynchronous tasks - Analytics: Python/Node-based ML services
Security & Compliance: - TLS/HTTPS for all communications - Encrypted storage for sensitive data (AES 256) - Role-based access control and audit logs - GDPR and local privacy compliance

2. Detailed Solution Description
The solution is a product- and industry-agnostic platform that connects artisans, manufacturers, and small-scale producers with global export-import markets. It adapts dynamically to the selected industry, supporting both the supply side (artisans) and demand side (marketplace/buyers) in a modular, scalable way.
Phase 1: Artisan Onboarding & Profile Creation
Objective: Enable the user to register, validate compliance, and build a functional, actionable digital profile.
Core Features: 1. Company & Tax Registration: Detect registrations, provide guided workflows. 2. Banking Information Integration: Link bank accounts, verify KYC, store securely. 3. Customer Profile Creation: Capture essential company/individual details. 4. Government Scheme Detection (Phase 1 Applicable): Fetch and store eligibility for downstream usage. 5. Intelligence Layer Initialization: Suggest reachable/out-of-reach markets, establish baseline metrics.
Outcome: Fully validated artisan profile, bank-linked, tax-compliant, ready for Phase 2.
Phase 2: Product & Market Layer
Objective: Enable artisan to define products and explore market insights.
Core Features: 1. Product Catalog Integration: Dynamic product/sub-product creation with conditional fields. 2. Market Intelligence: Demand data, trends, price benchmarking, news feeds. 3. Government Scheme Detection (Phase 2 Applicable): Apply production/export-related schemes. 4. Configurator Integration: Existing product configurator captures conditional product features.
Outcome: Market-ready product definitions with pricing, intelligence, and applicable schemes.
Phase 3: Artisan Input & Transaction Readiness
Objective: Capture production-ready inputs and ensure marketplace compliance.
Core Features: 1. Detailed Production Input Capture: Material, craftsmanship, quantity, custom designs. 2. Dynamic Compliance Checks: Validate inputs against marketplace standards and schemes. 3. Transaction Preparation: Finalize metadata, pricing, compliance, bank readiness.
Outcome: Artisan ready to supply to marketplace/export with validated product metadata.

5. System Architecture
5.1 High-Level Components
[Artisan/User]       |      v [Web / Mobile Frontend] --- Admin Dashboard      |      v [API Gateway / Backend Services]      |      |-- [Authentication Service]  (Phase 1)      |-- [Onboarding Service]      (Phase 1)      |-- [Market Intelligence Service] (Phase 2)      |-- [Product Management Service]  (Phase 3)      |-- [Scheme Management Service]   (Phase 1 & 2)      |-- [Document & Media Storage]      |-- [Analytics & Insights Engine]
5.2 Microservices Approach
	•	Authentication Service: OAuth2/JWT, token issuance.
	•	Onboarding Service: Phase 1 workflows, Phase 1 schemes.
	•	Market Intelligence Service: Trends, demand index, Phase 2 schemes.
	•	Product Management Service: Dynamic product forms, pricing guidance.
	•	Scheme Management Service: Centralized schemes, admin overlays.
	•	Admin Service: Field visibility, workflow control, overrides.
	•	Notification Service: SMS, Email, push notifications.
	•	Analytics Service: Insights on demand, trends, engagement.
5.3 Database Schema
	•	Artisan Profile, Product/Sub-Product, Market Intelligence JSON structures (detailed in original doc).

6. Government Schemes Integration
	•	Phase 1: Registration-related schemes.
	•	Phase 2: Product/market-related schemes.
	•	Sample JSON provided for Phase 1 & Phase 2 schemes.

7. Phase-Wise Flow
Phase 1: Artisan Onboarding   ↓ Verified Artisan Profile + Phase 1 Schemes   ↓ Phase 2: Market & Product Intelligence   ↓ Market/Product Recommendation + Phase 2 Schemes + Price Points   ↓ Phase 3: Product Input & Market Readiness   ↓ Market-Ready Product Submission + Buyer Matching

8. Dynamic Rules & Intelligence
	•	Premium Tier Calculation based on skill, capacity, certification.
	•	Market Accessibility: compliance + schemes.
	•	Price Suggestion: base + market + scheme overlay.
	•	Input Field Visibility: conditional, dynamic.

9. Key Advantages
	•	Industry-agnostic, scalable, configurable.
	•	Phased onboarding reduces friction.
	•	Dynamic scheme application minimizes admin overhead.
	•	Data-driven intelligence guides artisans efficiently.
	•	Admin dashboard control without redeployments.

10. Sample Use Case
	•	Artisan registers → Phase 1 profile + MSME scheme applied.
	•	Selects premium wool carpet → Phase 2 product definition → European market recommendation.
	•	Submits inputs → Phase 3 readiness check → Marketplace listing.

11. Additional Considerations
	•	Edge Case Handling: Scheme API downtime, bank verification failure, incomplete artisan input.
	•	Performance: Async processing for large datasets, caching intelligence results.
	•	Security & Audit: Full audit trail, role-based access, encryption.
