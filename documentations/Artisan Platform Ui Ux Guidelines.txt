Artisan Market Platform – UI/UX Guidelines Document
Objective
This document outlines the UI/UX guidelines for the Artisan Market Exposure Platform and the POC. The goal is to create a premium, top-class user experience that matches the scale and sophistication of the platform while remaining intuitive, accessible, and industry-agnostic. This is intended for a highly skilled reviewer and will guide both frontend development and UX design.

1. Design Principles
	•	User-Centric Design
	•	Focus on artisan ease-of-use; minimal cognitive load.
	•	Adaptive forms and workflows based on artisan type, industry, and compliance status.
	•	Consistency
	•	Uniform layout, typography, color scheme, and components across screens.
	•	Clear visual hierarchy and spacing.
	•	Accessibility
	•	WCAG 2.1 AA standards.
	•	Screen reader support, high contrast, keyboard navigation.
	•	Responsive Design
	•	Mobile-first design; optimized for tablets and desktops.
	•	Ensure forms, dashboards, and configurators are usable across devices.
	•	Intelligent Guidance
	•	Step-by-step walkthroughs for onboarding.
	•	Tooltips, info icons, and inline validation messages.
	•	Modularity & Extensibility
	•	Components should be reusable across industries.
	•	Dynamic forms should adapt to product/sub-product fields and market intelligence overlays.

2. UI Components & Patterns
2.1 Navigation
	•	Sidebar Navigation
	•	Industry selection, profile, product management, analytics, settings.
	•	Collapsible with icons and labels.
	•	Topbar
	•	User avatar, notifications, quick access to help/documentation.
	•	Breadcrumbs
	•	Track multi-step processes (onboarding → product configuration → submission).
2.2 Forms
	•	Dynamic Form Builder
	•	Fields appear/disappear based on conditional logic (tier, scheme, industry).
	•	Inline validations: mandatory fields, regex, numeric ranges.
	•	Input Types
	•	Text, number, dropdown, checkbox, radio buttons, date, file upload.
	•	Progress Indicators
	•	Show current step in multi-step forms.
	•	Tooltips & Help
	•	Contextual explanations for complex fields.
2.3 Dashboards
	•	Artisan Dashboard
	•	Overview: profile status, compliance, bank info, schemes applied.
	•	Quick access to product creation, market recommendations, production inputs.
	•	Market Intelligence Panel
	•	Visual indicators (charts, gauges) for demand, trends, and price tiers.
	•	Color-coded alerts for high/medium/low demand or market suitability.
2.4 Product Configurator
	•	Industry-Specific Templates
	•	Leather shoes: material, size, color, stitching, design complexity.
	•	Carpets: material, dimensions, weave type, design.
	•	Tier-Based Adjustments
	•	Premium/standard tiers dynamically adjust visible fields.
	•	Scheme Overlay
	•	Show applicable government schemes as a badge/tooltip next to fields.
2.5 Alerts & Notifications
	•	Inline Validation Alerts
	•	Red highlights for errors, green for success.
	•	System Notifications
	•	Toast messages for submissions, approvals, or errors.
	•	Scheme Alerts
	•	Display available schemes prominently during input.
2.6 Preview & Submission
	•	Real-Time Preview
	•	Show how product info will appear to buyers/market.
	•	Summary Page
	•	Consolidate artisan profile, product inputs, pricing, and market intelligence.
	•	Submission Confirmation
	•	Clear success message with next steps (market matching, buyer notifications).
2.7 Analytics & Insights
	•	Visual dashboards for artisans:
	•	Market trends, demand index, pricing guidance.
	•	Simple charts (bar, line, gauge) with legends.
	•	Allow drill-down per industry, product, or market.
2.8 Admin Panel (Optional POC Integration)
	•	Dynamic Field Control
	•	Toggle visibility, mandatory/optional, and default values.
	•	Scheme Management
	•	Overlay phase-based government schemes without redeployment.
	•	Price Modifiers
	•	Adjust premium/standard tiers dynamically.

3. UX Flow Recommendations
3.1 Onboarding Flow (Phase 1)
	•	Welcome / Industry selection.
	•	Registration & verification (Company / Individual).
	•	Tax / compliance status check.
	•	Bank integration.
	•	Profile summary with Phase 1 schemes.
3.2 Product Definition (Phase 2)
	•	Select industry → choose product/sub-product.
	•	Dynamic configurator form (conditional fields, tier adjustments).
	•	Market intelligence overlay (demand, trends, eligible markets).
	•	Phase 2 scheme application.
	•	Save & continue to production input.
3.3 Production Input & Submission (Phase 3)
	•	Input detailed production parameters (material, dimensions, packaging).
	•	Validate inputs with real-time alerts.
	•	Preview product & intelligence summary.
	•	Submit → confirmation & next steps.
3.4 General UX Enhancements
	•	Step indicators and breadcrumbs to reduce confusion.
	•	Inline guidance for complex fields.
	•	Consistent color coding for status, tiers, and schemes.
	•	Responsive layout for mobile-first usage.
	•	Minimalist, clean design to focus artisan attention on inputs.

4. Visual Design Guidelines
	•	Color Palette: Soft primary colors, neutral background, high-contrast alerts.
	•	Typography: Clear, readable fonts, consistent heading hierarchy.
	•	Spacing & Layout: Adequate whitespace, grid-based layouts.
	•	Icons & Imagery: Industry-relevant icons, intuitive symbols for tiers, schemes, and alerts.
	•	Animations: Subtle transitions for field visibility changes, hover states, and submission feedback.

5. POC UI/UX Deliverables
	•	Phase 1 Onboarding screens: Registration, profile summary, compliance and bank integration. 
	•	Phase 2 Product Configurator screens: Leather Shoes & Bhadohi Carpets, dynamic forms, market intelligence, and schemes overlay. 
	•	Phase 3 Production Input & Submission screens: Input validation, preview, confirmation. 
	•	Dashboards & Panels: Artisan overview, market insights, scheme alerts. 
	•	Interactive Mockups: Clickable prototype for stakeholder/demo review. 
	•	Design Assets: Color palette, typography guidelines, icons, and layouts.

6. Notes for Developers & Designers
	•	All forms and dashboards should be component-driven for reuse across industries. 
	•	Dynamic fields, schemes, and intelligence overlays must update in real-time based on artisan inputs. 
	•	Provide mock data for POC: 2 artisans, 2 products, 2 industries, and market intelligence per product. 
	•	Focus on high polish UI/UX: smooth transitions, clear visual hierarchy, easy navigation. 
	•	Ensure responsive design: mobile-first but fully functional on desktop.

Outcome: A highly intuitive, visually appealing, and modular UI/UX for the Artisan Market Platform POC that demonstrates onboarding, configurator-based product creation, market intelligence overlays, and production input submission for leather shoes and Bhadohi carpets.
