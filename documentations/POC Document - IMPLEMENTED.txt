POC Document: Artisan Market Exposure Platform - IMPLEMENTATION STATUS
================================================================================

STATUS: ✅ COMPLETE - All 3 Phases Successfully Implemented and Deployed

Objective
---------
Create a Proof of Concept (POC) demonstrating the first three phases of the Artisan Market Exposure Platform. The POC showcases the platform's ability to:
